# Fail if any shipped skill references an UNDECLARED plugin namespace.
#
# Declared-dependency invariant: skills under skills/ may reference the
# `gherlein:` namespace (this plugin) and the namespaces of declared runtime
# dependencies. Today that is `superpowers:` -- the plugin intentionally builds
# on the Superpowers pipeline, and `build-autonomous` verifies it is installed
# via a preflight (see skills/build-autonomous/SKILL.md, Phase 0). A reference to
# any OTHER plugin namespace is an error: it is an undeclared dependency, almost
# always a typo or a stray copy-paste. URL schemes (http, https, ...) are not
# skill references and are allowed.
#
# To add a new declared dependency: append its namespace to $allow below AND
# document/verify it (README prerequisites + a preflight in the skill that needs
# it), so the dependency is enforced at runtime, not just permitted here.
#
# The pristine baseline under vendor/ is intentionally NOT checked -- it is an
# unmodified upstream snapshot and legitimately contains upstream namespaces.
